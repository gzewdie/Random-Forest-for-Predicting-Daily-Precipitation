# Random-Forest-for-Predicting-Daily-Precipitation
In this project I presented a code implimenting the Random Forest Machine Learning method to predict daily large scale precipitation  using ECMWF data.  I used 29 predictor variables in the training.  The perormance of the prediction is validated using an indipendent data that is not used in the training.  See the figures for the results!
